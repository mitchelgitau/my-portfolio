<h4>Why Take programming</h4>
<div class="colum">
<p>I decided to take programming classes because these days the tech industry isnâ€™t just the tech industry. Computers and code are everywhere. Many industries rely on technology infrustructer
  that means <span class="reason"> more jobs for coders</span>.Again, <span class="reason"> more money</span>,  <span class="reason"> more schedule flexibility</span>, options to <span class="reason"> work from home or elsewhere</span>.</p>


<h5>Hobbies and Interests</h5>
 <p>Socializing with friends and family,coding, sports, traveling , art and design (drawing and painting)</p>
